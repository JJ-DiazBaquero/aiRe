This is web-app created with the shiny framework, as such, in order to run it locally the easiest way is to use rStudio IDE to create a local shiny web-server, follow [this guide](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/running.html) for more details.

This app comes already with some data from Bogota's air quality, you can use this data to explore aiRe's functionalities, plots, and to guide yourself on what kind of format does aiRe need in order to work, this can be found under the [databases folder]( https://github.com/jj-diaz1067/aiRe/tree/master/databases)
